# ▶️ How to Play

Press any key to start the game.

Watch carefully as the game highlights a color.

Click the same color.

Repeat the full sequence correctly to move to the next level.

If you click the wrong color, the game ends.

Press any key to restart.

# 🧠 Game Logic

A random color is selected and added to the gameSequence array.

User clicks are stored in the userSequence array.

The two arrays are compared after each click.

If they match → next level.

If not → game over.
